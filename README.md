# Portfolio

[![CI](https://github.com/kclejeune/portfolio/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kclejeune/portfolio/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Basic personal site written with SvelteKit as an overpowered static site generator.
SvelteKit allows for development and page rendering in JavaScript, but remains compatible with non-js browsers.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
