        <p>Hey, I'm Kennan!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I'm a recent Computer Science graduate and current M.S. Computer
            Science candidate at Case Western Reserve University.â€‹ I started
            programming on calculators with TI-BASIC back in high school, and
            I've been addicted ever since. Outside of my studies, I'm an avid
            cyclist, musician, linux enthusiast, and speedcuber.
        </p>

        <p>
            I currently do research in the <Link

                CWRU Department of Computer and Data Sciences

            under Dr. Soumya Ray. My work investigates the properties of knowledge
            propogation through social networks in multi-agent learning systems,
            and aims to develop dynamic optimization methods to achieve faster training
            convergence for the network as a whole.

        <p>
            After graduation, I'm transitioning to full time work on Software
            Engineering and Data Science at the
            <Link url="https://www.jhuapl.edu/">
                Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
            </Link>, where I do work on machine learning research for DNA threat
            classification and full stack software engineering with Angular and
            Spring.
