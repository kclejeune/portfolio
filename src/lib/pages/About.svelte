    <p>Hey, I'm Kennan!</p>
    <p>
      I first started programming on calculators with TI-BASIC back in high
      school, and I've been addicted ever since. In my spare time, I love
      cycling, skiing, and contributing to open-source software. I was an
      active competitor in the Rubik's Cube speedsolving community, where
      <Link url="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013LEJE03"
        >my highlights</Link
      > included a North American Record, 90 podium finishes, and global 12th place
      rank for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube.
    </p>

      I completed my BS and MS in Computer Science at <Link

      >
      with my thesis "Dynamic Structure Adaptation for Communities of Learning Machines,"
      supervised by Dr. Soumya Ray. Now, I'm a software enginer at
      <Link url="https://www.jhuapl.edu/">
        the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
      </Link>. My current work focuses on applying NLP and ontological knowledge representation
      detect early stage biothreats using public information.
