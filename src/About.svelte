        Hey, I'm Kennan!
        <br /><br />
        I'm a recent Computer Science graduate and current M.S. Computer Science
        candidate at Case Western Reserve University.â€‹ I started programming on calculators
        with TI-BASIC back in high school, and I've been addicted ever since. Outside
        of my studies, I'm an avid cyclist, musician, linux enthusiast, and speedcuber.
        <br /><br />
        I currently do research in the

        under Dr. Soumya Ray. My work investigates the properties of knowledge
        propogation through social networks in multi-agent learning systems, and
        aims to develop dynamic optimization methods to achieve faster training
        convergence for the network as a whole.
        <br /><br />
        After graduation, I'm transitioning to full time work on Software Engineering
        and Data Science at the
        <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/"
            >Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory</a
        >, where I do work on machine learning research for DNA threat
        classification and full stack software engineering with Angular and
        Spring.
